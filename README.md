### Overview

This is a project that a fellow classmate and I did for a class. Seahawk Explorer is a mobile application made using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. The app is 
targeted towards new students at UNCW. The app is meant to make navigating campus and learning about UNCW easier. The app has a login screen, sign-up screen, 
homepage, explore page, and a profile page that displays landmarks on campus that a user has favorited. Below is a video showcasing the app.
